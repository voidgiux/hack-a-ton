# \# hack-a-ton

A fake terminal "hacking" simulation that fills your screen with random commands and nonsense. To use as an idle animation, to look busy, or just for fun.

##### 

###### A project for the boot.dev 2025 Hackaton ( https://blog.boot.dev/news/hackathon-2025/ )

##### 

##### Usage:

1. Clone repo: ```git clone https://github.com/voidgiux/hack-a-ton```

2. Enter the directory: ```cd hack-a-ton```

3. Run: ```python3 hack-a-ton.py```
( or with an optional argument: ```python3 hack-a-ton.py --target=something.url```

Showcasing the usage of Python3: 

- functions
- working with files
- lists
- try/except
- external modules: time, random, os, argparse

Note:
The commands don’t do anything (sorry, no real hacking magic here).
They’re just for show, inspired by real tools, games, and movies.

---
The messages are generated randomly. Occasionally, some fun combinations appear.
